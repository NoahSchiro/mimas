[Mimas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas) is a fleet commander for the game [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/). SpaceTraders is played by interacting with an https API and therefore can be automated with code.

If you are interested in playing the game, then this repository is, for all intents and purposes, "spoilers" for the game. Part of the fun and interest for the game is working out your own solutions to the problems you face through coding!
